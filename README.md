# Azure Java

Azure JAVA is a fresh from scratch Emulation software which emulates Habbo. The previous Azure base was destroyed on several factors, 
and missing alot of core code and functionality so we thought it would just be easy to create a new project in JAVA.

Java Features
>Netty - Networking     
>Gradle - Building     
>HikariCP - Connection Pooling     
>Guice     
>Hibernate, log4j - Logging
